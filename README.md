# Stealth Game by AdishWar

This is a basic game I made to practise Unity3D and learn C# language, and get familiar with Unity's C# API. All the 3 objectives are completed and I'm on my next game now :)

# About the game:

The game is a simple one-level stealth game. There are guards that are patrolling a maze, and you are a yellow spy that has to reach the green glowing square on the other side of the map. That's it. 

Thanks for checking this out.

# For coders:

The repository contains 2 branches. The master branch contains all the basic C# code to create your own level. The Level-1 branch contains a completed level, which you can go ahead and build to create the playable executable file.

# Credits:

This game with the awesome Unity beginner tutorial series by Sebastian Lague. Its a 25 episode series that is a brilliant introducation to Unity for a novice. The last 3 episodes of the series were the guide for this series.
